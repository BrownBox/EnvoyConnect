Supercharge your user profiles. Simple, powerful contact relationship management.

== Description ==

EnvoyConnect brings core CRM functionality to WordPress that is infinitely extensible. Leveraging a flexible user profile, an extensible user history and a searchable user database, you can create virtually any application that involves users and your interactions with them.

Upon installation you can build user profiles by adding and arranging as many custom fields as you need and then search those fields to find commonalities or differences. Each user profile has a history tab where you can track detailed user activity using a built-in note system and which can be extended easily to include custom post-types attributable to each user. Lastly, you can create contact forms from your existing user fields that automatically add new contacts to your database and append the details to the user account even if the contact already exists. 

These are the basics of any CRM (contact relationship management) application and EnvoyConnect does it all using only the core WordPress APIs.

**Need to do more?** The pro version, adds additional core functionality integrated into the same application for a seamless user interface and we are releasing additional add-ons for additional functionality and workflows.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What's this all about? =

Since 2010 we've built out EnvoyConnect to meet the needs of clients in both the for-profit and non-profit sectors who were managing thousands of user profiles and financial transactions. Most of our clients wanted an integrated approach to relationship management that simply couldn't be found with hosted solutions and the constant juggling between several different applications was too cumbersome. In 2012 we decided to release EnvoyConnect as a plugin everyone could use but we took a year to ensure that we had a mature and stable product to offer before releasing it. We hope you find it useful.

= What's with the name? =

The "Pau" in EnvoyConnect is a stylized acronym for "Perspectives on the Actions of Users." You can pronounce it "paw" or "pow" as you like -- it answers to either.
